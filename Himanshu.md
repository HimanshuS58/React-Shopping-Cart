# Installed tailwind CSS, React router dom & React-icons

# check the 'isActive' state of NavLink inside Navbar.jsx and see how it is define.

# read about relative and absolute position difference: https://www.youtube.com/shorts/jyi8s_AyxKA
Note: while defining an element as absolute first mention its parent element as relative otherwise it align with the page body.

# In this project we have done some of our own stuff which is different from the video like:
 - Configuration of routing in App.js file (in video it is define inside index.js file).
 - Use of useEffect() in Products.jsx file.
 - 'isActive' state definition using NavLink inside Navbar.jsx file.
